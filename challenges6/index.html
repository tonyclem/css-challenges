          Wonder when CSS layout techniques will be less of an art and more of a
          science.

          "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only
          way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And
          the only way to do great work is to love what you do."<br />

          "There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take
          a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think
          you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like
          because you think it will look good on your resume. Isn't that a
          little like saving up sex for your old age?"<br />

          "Yes, I've made a great deal of dough from my fiction, but I never set
          a single word down on paper with the thought of being paid for it ...
          I have written because it fulfilled me. Maybe it paid off the mortgage
          on the house and got the kids through college, but those things were
          on the side--I did it for the buzz. I did it for the pure joy of the
          thing. And if you can do it for the joy, you can do it forever."
